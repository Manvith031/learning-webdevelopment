 <p>My Review of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani ❤️🎬<br/>

This movie isn’t just my favorite – it’s a feeling.

From the very first scene, I was hooked. The characters, the story, the dialogues – everything just hits differently. I loved how Bunny is so full of dreams, always chasing the next adventure, and how Naina quietly grows into someone strong, confident, and kind. Their chemistry? Absolutely perfect.

The friend group – Avi and Aditi – added so much life and realness. The way they fight, laugh, cry, and still stay together… it made me miss my own friends. That Manali trip? Pure vibes. And that reunion at Aditi’s wedding – emotional, nostalgic, beautiful.

The songs? Ilahi, Kabira, Badtameez Dil – each one is a mood. I still listen to them when I need to feel something real.

What I love most is how the movie shows that chasing your dreams is amazing, but sharing those moments with the people you love is what makes life complete.

I’ve watched it so many times and I’ll never get tired of it. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani isn’t just a film – it’s a reminder to live, to love, and to hold on to the people who matter.</p>

 <p><b>My Review of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara 🌍❤️</b><br/>

This movie isn’t just a film — it’s an experience. Every time I watch it, I feel like I’m on that road trip with Arjun, Kabir, and Imran. It teaches you something important in the most fun, emotional, and beautiful way possible: you only live once — so live fully.

Spain looked like a dream, but what really stayed with me was how each character faced something deep — fear, guilt, love, freedom. The skydiving scene, deep sea diving, and the bull run – they weren’t just thrills, they were life lessons. Breaking comfort zones, letting go of control, forgiving the past… it was all so powerful.

Farhan Akhtar as Imran was my favorite – his poetry, humor, and emotional depth hit hard. Hrithik Roshan's transformation from a workaholic to someone who feels alive again was amazing to watch. And Abhay Deol played Kabir so naturally – stuck between what he wants and what others expect.

And the poetry? Toh Zinda Ho Tum… 🔥 I still get goosebumps. Javed Akhtar’s words, with Farhan’s voice, touched my soul.

The music, the cinematography, the message — everything in ZNMD is perfect. It's one of those rare films that makes you want to pack a bag, call your friends, and just go live. Laugh, cry, forgive, love, and breathe.

Because… Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara 🌅

 <br/><br/><h3>Taare Zameen par</h3>

 <p>My Review of Taare Zameen Par 🌟💔<br/>

Taare Zameen Par isn’t just a movie — it’s an eye-opener. Every time I watch it, it touches something deep inside me. It made me see the world through the eyes of a child who was never understood, just judged.

Ishaan Awasthi – that little boy – his silence, his imagination, his pain… it broke my heart. So many kids are like him, struggling quietly while the world keeps shouting “try harder.” But this film showed that sometimes, they don’t need pressure — they just need someone to believe in them.

And when Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) enters the story, everything changes. That scene where he explains dyslexia to the parents… I had tears in my eyes. He didn’t just teach Ishaan how to read or write — he taught him how to believe in himself again.

The songs — especially Maa — I can’t even describe what it makes me feel. It’s the purest love I’ve ever seen in a movie. And Kholo Kholo and Jame Raho captured the school life and its pressure so perfectly.

This movie taught me that every child is special, and sometimes, the ones we think are “lazy” or “different” are the ones with the most beautiful minds.

If I ever forget what empathy feels like, I just rewatch Taare Zameen Par — and it reminds me.</p>
