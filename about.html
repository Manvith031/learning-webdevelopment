    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a curious and motivated first-year student with a strong drive to learn and create. While I’ve just started my journey in the world of technology, I’ve already begun exploring languages like C++, Python, and HTML. I’m currently diving into Android app development and Full Stack Development, eager to build real, impactful projects that blend fun with functionality. I believe learning should be hands-on and creative — not just about solving problems, but about creating something meaningful.

Outside of academics, I’m someone who thinks deeply about the world and the people around me. Whether it’s contemplating the ethics of fictional stories like Squid Game or managing real-life responsibilities like planning hostel expenses and savings, I try to act with empathy, awareness, and a sense of responsibility. I also value the little details of life — from why my feet reacted to not wearing slippers, to how I manage time and energy between studies and hobbies.

This website is part of my larger journey — a space where I can share what I learn, build cool stuff, and connect with people who are also growing and experimenting in their own ways. If you’re someone who enjoys thoughtful conversations, practical tech, and a touch of humor and honesty, then we already have something in common. Let’s grow together!</p>
